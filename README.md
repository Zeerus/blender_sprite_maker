# Isometric Sprite Generator for Blender

To install:
- Edit the config.yml file to point to the blender executable for blender_path
- Edit the config.yml file to point to the desired blend file
- Edit the config.yml file to point to the blender python executable for blender_path
  - Usually this is under your blender install directory e.g. `Blender/version_num/python/bin/python.exe`
- Run install.ps1 as administrator

To run: `blender -b /path/to/blend_file.blend -P prite_script_blender.py` OR the batch file `run.ps1` for the lazy

As an example I have set up the following Blend file with an animated model with 8 orthographic cameras looking at the model from 45 degrees up and 45 degree increments in a full circle around the model.

The cameras are set up to render at 40x80px and results in the following:
